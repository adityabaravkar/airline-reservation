# Project Notes

- We initially started with a heavy agile-based development process. The incomplete/defunct backlog can be seen at:
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVvdXz-tGIeUCeCwarzgpEkQwag26OAUWMOIn2ZsYXQ/edit#gid=0
  (NOTE: a pdf version of this is also in the meeting documents folder named "CMPE 202 Project Task Breakdown and Backlog - Sheet1.pdf")

- We later on moved on to a mix of XP and a kanban-based approach. The project chart/board can be found in this git repository under the projects tab [projects > Airline Application]
